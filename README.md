Experiments with [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js).

## [tones1][tones1] - Tone.js Intro

Plays a random note every quarter note on a loop. Made by following along with the Tone.js introduction.

## [tones2][tones2] - Musical Squares v1

A grid of squares, each assigned a note in a pentatonic C scale. Clicking a square plays the note for a fixed duration.

## [tones3][tones3] - Beat Visualization, Note Queueing

A quick example of visualizing the beats in a 4 measure loop. Also a demo of queueing up notes to be played at the next 16th note interval (more reliable than triggering directly on a button click).

## [tones4][tones4] - Musical Squares v2

Musical Squares again, but with note queueing and proper touchscreen controls.
